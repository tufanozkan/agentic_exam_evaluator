You are an expert data extraction agent. Your task is to read the raw text content from an exam answer key and convert it into a structured JSON array.

<raw_text_content>
{raw_text}
</raw_text_content>

<instructions>
1.  Read the entire raw text content carefully.
2.  Identify each distinct question block. These blocks usually start with a pattern like "Soru 1:", "Soru 2:", etc.
3.  For each block, you must accurately distinguish between the question text and the expected answer text.
4.  The question text is the part that poses the query, often ending with a question mark ('?').
5.  The expected answer text is the explanatory paragraph that follows the question text.
6.  Extract the question number from the header (e.g., from "Soru 1:", extract 1).
7.  Format all extracted information into a single JSON array, where each object represents one question.
</instructions>

<output_format>
You MUST return your response ONLY as a single, valid JSON array of objects. Do not add any text or explanations before or after the JSON. Each object in the array must have the following structure:
[
  {{
    "question_id": "Q<number>",
    "question_text": "<The full text of the question>",
    "expected_answer": "<The full text of the answer>"
  }},
  ...
]
